My impetus to see the world began with an obsession to climb in some of the world’s highest mountains. Trudging off to these remote areas to reach enticing peaks, I first discovered the joys of living with the mountain people. This has lead to speaking fluent Spanish, and spending a lot of her time in South America where she I had an adobe apartment in the bohemian district of Lima.

I have had a variety of careers all involving education and the environment:  I was the owner of an outdoor adventure company in Seattle, a program developer and educator, a coordinator for college environmental education, a back country crew leader for restoration and trail work in the North cascades and Alaska, a geologist in the Olympic National Park, wilderness guide in the Pacific Northwest and currently the co-founder and board member of Crooked Trails, a nonprofit international travel company as well as a Property manager and investor in real estate and short term rentals.

Hi, I'm Alan and I was originally born and raised in Dallas, TX and move to Seattle in 2002. I love to travel and experience new cultures around the world. I learned not to take things for granted and have more of an open mind. There are a lot of beauty out there waiting for us to see.

With this in mind, I opened my homes for guests to experience the local culture and soak in Seattle's natural beauty. Hopefully, your stay will make a lasting memory!

The neighborhood developed quickly during the early 20th century after the establishment of the University of Washington to the east. With trolley tracks laid through the neighborhood as early as 1907, Wallingford is a classic streetcar suburb, typified by its many 1920s era box houses and bungalows. Commercial development is primarily concentrated along North 45th Street where a number of iconic structures stand including the neon ""WALLINGFORD"" sign, the Wallingford Center, and the original Dick's Drive-In. With its central location, numerous public amenities, including the world-renowned Gas Works Park, and views of both the Olympic and Cascade mountains, Wallingford has long been home to many middle and upper-class families.

It’s always fun to grab a table on the deck at one of the restaurants along the lake (like Eastlake Bar and Grill or Serafina) so you can watch the boats and seaplanes. If you’ve got the time, you can go on your very own seaplane ride and get a great view of Seattle, and Eastlake of course!",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/prohost-api/Hosting-753839853704080183/original/dbc15fd3-641f-4162-867e-7a429b548244.jpeg,484899828,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/484899828,Amy,10/24/22,,"Welcome to our community!

When I first arrived in the Pacific Northwest, it felt like coming home. My husband is a 5th generation Seattleite.  I knew this was the place for my kids to grow and thrive.  For almost 20 years I helped people find their homes here, helping my neighbors and my community preserving the history of their older homes.  

I have a genuine interest in houses, architecture, & construction and an interest to show you the beauty of our area.
 
Since 2000, I managed thousands of furnished rental homes,  If you live here now and want a change, please let us know.

We love to travel and are drawn to vacation homes as there is so much opportunity to spend time together and make memories, whether grilling together on the deck, or snuggling up to a movie after a day of exploring the great outdoors.
Still, most homes (even expensive ones) were missing the ""Luxury"" factor and the concierge services we used to enjoy at hotels. So, we brought that element into our collection of vacation homes.
We curate the entire experience, bringing together the best team of support staff, designers, and local talent. From excursions and local tours, to private chefs and amenities usually only found in five star resorts, our guests can relax and enjoy not only a gorgeous home with all the comforts, but also an experience to remember without the hassles.
