    "# Final Project Report: Airbnb & Neighborhood Crime\n",
    "*Spring 2023, HCDE 410: Human Data Interation*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Motivation and Problem Statement\n",
    "My goal is to be more informed about the consequences of homestay properties in local neighborhoods. For the purpose of this project, I will mostly focus the scope on finding a correlation between Airbnbs and crime reports in Seattle, rather than trying to prove causation. As a stretch goal, I would also want to figure out a way to rate the severity of the crime, not just the quantity of the reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan to create a map visualization of Airbnbs and reported crime in Seattle. At first glance, this can seem useful for people who are worried about safety while planning trips or vacations in the Seattle area. However, it is important to note that the presence of crime reports is not a sufficient measure of safety. The decontextualization of large datasets like the ones used in this project can lead to distorted visualizations. Thus, it is important to be careful and thoughtful when presenting these findings, especially since this topic can instill fear in the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Selected\n",
    "For this project, I plan to use the following two datasets:\n",
    "* [Seattle Police Department (SPD) Crime Data (2008-present)](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5)\n",
    "    * License: Public Domain\n",
    "* [Inside Airbnb (skip to Seattle, Washington, United States)](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)\n",
    "    * License: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential ethical considerations to using these datasets are anonymity and misinterpretation of crime severity. Making visualizations of reported crime in the same neighborhoods as the Airbnb listings might discourage people from booking and affect their reviews. Another consideration is that the data only contains reported crime. Particular types of crime could be underreported, meaning the data is not completely representative of Seattle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background and Related Work\n",
    "The effect of homestays has already been researched since the rise of companies like Airbnb. According to a [2021 study about Airbnb and neighborhood crime](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253315), their findings support “the notion that the prevalence of Airbnb listings erodes the natural ability of a neighborhood to prevent crime.” A [different study](https://thecrimereport.org/2021/08/06/is-there-a-link-between-airbnb-and-neighborhood-crime-rates/) focused on the different types of Airbnb listings and their correlation with crime. This inspired me to try to find the geospatial correlation between Airbnb clusters and the different types of crime and their severity."

    "## Research Questions\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a visualization of reported crime and Airbnbs in the Seattle area and confirm the relationship (or lack thereof) between Airbnbs and local crime. The motivation behind this project was to learn and see which Airbnbs are located in low-crime areas so I, and other users, can be more informed about the historic crime rates and consequences of homestay properties in local neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses:** There will be more Airbnbs with higher ratings in or near locations with lower rates of reported crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Questions:**\n",
    "* Which areas have the most and least Airbnbs? Crime rates?\n",
    "* Which areas have the highest and lowest Airbnb ratings?\n",
    "* Which offense types are the most and least frequent?\n",
    "* What is the relationship between Airbnbs and crime rates?"

Since hosts may forget to update or remove thier listing, the date of the last review can be helpful in making sure the Airbnb is still in use. The current datasets are a snapshot of the Airbnb listings from March 24, 2023 so any listings removed before that time do not appear in this dataset. Although the *abnb_raw_data* dictionary is valuable for analyzing Airbnb clusters, I needed the more [detailed listings data](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/wa/seattle/2023-03-24/data/listings.csv.gz), which also contained the *host_since* datetimes. Unlike the general listings data, this detailed data is much larger. Thus, I downloaded the file, sorted by the *host_since* datetimes, and deleted the rows of data outside of 2022.

    "However, there are several considerations with the available information about the Airbnb listings. First, there is no indication of whether a host had any gaps in their operations as Airbnb host. Secondly, there are flaws to using the *host_since* datetimes to determine when the listing first opened since they could have registered as guests first, before they decided to host. The *host_since* is actually a record of when the user registered for an Airbnb account and does not differentiate between guests and hosts. The data also contains information such as the date of the first and last review. While the first review date could be a close enough substitute for when the Airbnb was first listed, there is no guarantee that the first guests wrote a review or if the Airbnb was booked close to the date it was first listed. Thus, I decided to use the *host_since* dates instead.
