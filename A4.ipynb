    "## Motivation and Problem Statement\n",
    "I plan to create a map visualization of Airbnbs and reported crime in Seattle. From a practical perspective, this can potentially be useful for people who are worried about safety while planning trips or vacations in the Seattle area. Ultimately I want to learn which areas are reasonably safe and which should be avoided so I can recommend locations to friends/family that are visiting. It is possible to do this by searching for crime data in the each neighborhood separately, but a map visualization with both datasets would be more efficient. As a stretch goal, I would also want to figure out a way to rate the severity of the crime, not just the quantity of the reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Selected\n",
    "* [SPD Crime Data (2008-present)](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5)\n",
    "    * License: Public Domain\n",
    "* [Airbnb Data (skip to Seattle, Washington, United States)](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)\n",
    "    * License: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I plan to use two datasets. The first is the SPD crime data from the [Seattle Open Data portal](https://data.seattle.gov/). The SPD crime data has relevant information such as the report time/date, crime against category (i.e. property or society), offense, and location (longitude and latitude). It also contains other data like the offense id, sector, and precint that are less relevant but could be interesting to look at. I would probably check that the offense ids are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is the data of Airbnb listings, reviews, and neighborhoods in Seattle, WA. The listings data in particular will be useful for map visualizations since it has the location (longitude and latitude), price, reviews, and other identifiers. The Airbnb data only shows quarterly data from the last year, up to March 24th, 2023. Since the SPD crime dataset is very large (17 columns and 1.05M rows), this works well since I plan to only use the data from the past year. There was a change in management systems for the SPD crime data in 2019, but since I will only look at the data in 2022-2023, this should not be an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential ethical considerations to using this dataset is anonymity and misinterpretation of crime severity. Making visualizations of reported crime in the same neighborhoods as the Airbnb listings might discourage people from booking and affect their reviews. Another consideration is that the data only contains reported crime. So, it does not always mean it'll be safer than other areas with more reported crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unknowns and Dependencies\n",
    "One factor that could impact my ability to complete this project is if the Airbnb data were to be updated. I would have to request for the archived data and that could take time that I won't necessarily have. Some other factors are the completeness of the SPD crime data and my limited knowledge of map visualizations in Python. Incomplete data could negatively impact my project and I would need time to learn how to create maps that have the level of detail and customization I need."

    "## Overview and Research Questions\n",
    "The goal of this project is to create a visualization of reported crime and Airbnbs in the Seattle area and understand the link between Airbnbs and local crime (if there even is one). The motivation behind this project was to learn and see which Airbnbs are located in low-crime areas so I, and other users, can feel more safe during trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses:** There will be more Airbnbs with higher ratings in or near locations with lower rates of reported crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Questions:**\n",
    "* Which areas have the most and least Airbnbs?\n",
    "* Which areas have the highest and lowest Airbnb ratings?\n",
    "* Is there a link between Airbnbs and reported crime? If there is...\n",
    "  * What is the impact of reported crime on Airbnb ratings (or vice-versa)?\n",
    "  * What is the impact of reported crime on the amount of Airbnbs in the area (or vice-versa)?\n",
