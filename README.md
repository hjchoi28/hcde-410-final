# hcde-410-final
Final project for HCDE 410: Human Data Interaction

For my final project, I will create a map visualization of Airbnb listings and reported crimes in Seattle using the following datasets:

* [SPD Crime Data (2008-present)](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5)
    * License: Public Domain
    * Obtained through the [Socrata Open Data (SODA) API](https://dev.socrata.com/), which allows you to access open data resources from governments.
* [Airbnb Data (skip to Seattle, Washington, United States)](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)
    * License: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

The purpose is to show which neighborhoods have lower rates of crime so that someone booking Airbnbs in the Seattle area could feel safer.
