# hcde-410-final
Final project for HCDE 410: Human Data Interaction

For my final project, I compared Airbnb listings and reported crimes in Seattle using the datasets listed below. The purpose was to be more informed about the consequences of homestay properties in local neighborhoods. Thus, I aimed to answer the following three research questions:

1. Which areas have the most and least Airbnbs? Crime rates?
2. Which offense types are the most and least frequent?
3. What is the relationship between Airbnbs and crime rates?

While working and doing background research, the scope and APIs used for my actual project had changed compared to initial project plan. However, the datasets I used remained the same.
